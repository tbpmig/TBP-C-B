\section{Committees} % 1) standing committees 2) temporary committees
\begin{enumsubsection}
\item{Purpose} Committees are intended to facilitate additional chapter activity and provide members additional involvement opportunities.  Committee function and schedule will be determined by the chair, with input from the committee members. Committees are distinct from Teams in that Teams are comprised of officers with similar but distinct responsibilities, while committees are open to any member, per their selection procedures, and are, in general,  geared toward a more focused task.
\item{Standing Committees} The standing committees are the Professional Development Committee, Website Committee, Book Swap Committee, K-12 Outreach Committee, and Group Leaders Committee. The membership and duties of each are listed in Appendix~\ref{sec:standingCommittees}.

\item*{Chair} May be chaired by an officer or another active member, as selected by the officer corps. 
\item*{Membership} Will be composed of  members on a volunteer basis.

An extension of the ad hoc committee requires a simple majority vote of the body, and may not be for longer than another year. A committee may not exist as ad hoc for more than three years. Any ad hoc committee that has existed for three years cannot be recreated as ad hoc without a gap of at least one year.
\end{enumsubsubsection}
\end{enumsubsection}
\section{Chairs}
\begin{enumsubsection}

\item{Creation} Chair positions may be created by the officer corps or the general membership at any time by a simple majority vote at any time. Chair positions may exist for any length of time, though chairs should be appointed at least semesterly.
